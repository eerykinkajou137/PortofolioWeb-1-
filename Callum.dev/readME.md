Welcome!

The aim of this prject is to deepen my understanding of the bare bones of modern day websites, whilst giving me a rough idea of of what i want my portfolio website to look like.w

# Design:

The website will have a fixed header to the left allowing users to scroll webcontent on the right side.
Buttons to navigate through the page's content will be stiles onto the header.
At lower resolutions the header will no longer be fixed and be another section of the webpage.

# Tech:

The website is meant to deepen my foundation hence vanilla languages will be used as the building blocks for the website

~ Vanilla JavaScript (Basic)
~ Basic CSS (no frameworks)
~ Regular HTML
